This is intended to be a collection of basic DSP algorithms
Currently implemented are:
-Convolution/Cross-correlation in quadratic (O(N^2)) time
-FFT (non-recursive Cooley-Tuckey algorithm without extra storage)
-some bit reversal routines for bytes and integers

TODO:
-FFT for real-only data
-Convolution/Cross-correlation using fft in linearithmic (O(N*log(N)) time
-some demodulation algorithm for sound frequency detection
-demos:
	polynomial multiplication
	2d convolution for images (blur, edge detection)
	audio effects (delay, shift etc)
-documentation and comments
